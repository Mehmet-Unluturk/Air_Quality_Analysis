# Air Quality Analysis

This project aims to analyze air quality data obtained from the OpenAQ API. The process involves retrieving air quality data from the OpenAQ website using their API, cleaning and organizing the data, labeling it into categories such as 'good', 'moderate', and 'unhealthy', analyzing the data using SQL queries with SQLite 3, and finally, creating a dashboard using Power BI.


## Project Overview
